9600 Baud and 8N1 is used by the UpConverter.<br>
*Note: Do not use a normal RS232 to USB adapter, it will not work.*

## Supported Board

## Software installation

There is no need to install the software. Unzip the file and all its subdirectories to a folder of your choice (e.g. „programs“ or USB-stick) and run the executable.<br>
Please don't touch the structure of the subdirectories and files, take it as it is. Of course you may define an Alias of the executable as you like.<br>
On exit, size/position of the window and the actual settings are preserved.

## Program Manual...

…doesn’t exist. The Program is self explanatory. Please move the mouse cursor over the desired item, wait 1 second and read the tool tip.
