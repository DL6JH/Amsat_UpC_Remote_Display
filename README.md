*Note: Do not use a normal RS232 to USB adapter, it will not work.*

## Supported Board

## Software installation

There is no need to install the software. Unzip the file and all its subdirecories to a folder of your choice (e.g. „programs“ or USB-stick) and run the executable.
Please don't touch the structure of the subdirectories and files, take it as it is. Of course you may define an Alias of the executable as you like.
On exit, size/position of the window and the actual settings are preserved.

## Program Manual...

…doesn’t exist. The Program is self explanatory. Please move the mouse cursor over the desired item, wait 1 second and read the tool tip.
